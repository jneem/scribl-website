Make simple videos using handwriting and speech.

- *Talk.* State-of-the-art neural-network-based noise cancellation means you
  get decent sound even from the lousiest built-in laptop microphone.
- *Write.* Scribl plays back your video in slow motion so that you can write in sync with the audio.
- *Share.* Export your video as an mp4 file for sharing to youtube or elsewhere.
